                I'm studying Computer Science. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Experience in the following:
                <br>
                > Python 
                <br>
                > Java 
                <br>
                > HTML/CSS/Javascript
                <br>
                > C 
                <br>
                > SQL
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm always on the hunt for new learning opportunities.

                I went to Taiwan to complete a work and cultural exchange program.
                We completed 4 weeks of intensive language training, alongside some
                sightseeing and LOTS of good food. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I also completed a 5-week internship where I was tasked 
                to create a chatbot for FAQs. This produced a range of challenges, 
                because not only had I never made a chatbot before, but it also needed
                to be in both English and Mandarin, accounting for messages that were 
                a mixture of both. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This was an incredibly rewarding experience on the whole. I made some 
                life long connections with people located all around the world, all the 
                way from the UK to New Zealand to South Africa.  
                <br>
                <br>
                Visiting Jiufen, a small town that inspired the setting for the movie 'Spirited Away', 
                experiencing the Wulai natural hot springs (and learning from the locals how to 
                ensure the water was at a good temperature), camping in Alishan and the smelling the aroma 
                wafting from the danbing stall opposite my workplace - I would redo it all again in a heartbeat!
